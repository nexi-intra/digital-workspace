**Welcome to Nexi Digital Workspace**

Welcome to the Nexi Digital Workspace! As we embark on a transformative journey to streamline business operations, our small but mighty team is poised to revolutionize how we approach productivity and workflow management. Our core team consists of two dedicated developers and one adept colleague focusing on monitoring. Together, we are committed to developing a comprehensive portfolio of business productivity applications.

Over the past seven years, we have explored various solutions, including tools built in PowerApps and Power Automate, utilizing the capabilities of Dataverse. However, our experiences have led us to realize the limitations and technical debt associated with these tools, which can rapidly accumulate and hinder progress.

Our vision at Nexi Digital Workspace is to move beyond these limitations by creating bespoke applications tailored to meet the evolving needs of our business. Our goal is to replace existing tools with more efficient, scalable, and user-friendly alternatives. By doing so, we aim to enhance productivity, reduce complexity, and foster a more integrated digital environment.

Our journey is just beginning, and we are excited to innovate and build solutions that not only meet our current needs but also anticipate future challenges. Join us as we pave the way for a smarter, more connected workplace.
